"# TextFilter" 

The program is a console application. You will need to build the exe and then run it by entering the file path first then either v to filter vowels, s to filter the short words or t to filter the letters that contain the letter t. You can do combinations of these arguments too for example vs to filter by vowels in the middle and short words.
